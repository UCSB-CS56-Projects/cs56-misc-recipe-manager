This is a GUI application that holds and collects data from the user to contain an easily-accessible list of recipes. The user can enter his/her own recipes and access them for future use.

As a chef, I can store my recipes in this application so I can edit and access them when I am cooking.

The software runs. On the left hand side of the window, there is a list of recipes that the user has entered.
