(a) This is a GUI application that holds and collects data from the user to contain an easily-accessible list of recipes. The user can enter his/her own recipes and access them for future use.

(b) As a chef, I can store my recipes in this application so I can edit and access them when I am cooking.

(c) The software runs. On the left hand side of the window, there is a list of recipes that the user has entered. If you click on the File tab in the upper left corner, you can add a new recipe, delete, load a list, save a list, add images, delete images, search recipes, search for ingredients, and select a default recipe list.

(d) As a user who is cooking in smaller or larger portions, it would be nice to scale ingredient amounts to make smaller or larger batches. Also, it would nice to have categories to be able to sort the recipes better (maybe using a tag system of some sort). It would be nice to have a home page popup that would show instructions on how to use the application. This can be defaulted to be hidden with a checkbox that the user can toggle in a menu. Also, renaming the "File" menu to something better would be be more obvious. 

(e) An improvement to the README.md file would be to add the fact that you have to click "File" to open the menu. Also, an explanation of the menus would be useful, since you kind of have to infer what each one does. For example, the "search for recipe" option is not obvious that it actually searches for an ingredient. 

(f) The current build.xml file seems to be in shape. All targets have descriptions.

(g) Issues listed on the README.md:
- General improvements on all search functions could be added so that the user can search recipes/ingredients more easily.
- When the JFrame window is small, the user sometimes cannot see the entire recipe on the screen, even if they scroll
- Image tests in RecipePanelTest.java (currently commented out) are generating exceptions despite passing
- Deleting both sample recipes leaves the 2nd recipe's image on the screen

(h) Some issues we have found include:
- There seems to be an issue with searching for ingredients. When there is more than one recipe with the same ingredient, it is unclear which recipe is shown. It would be useful to have recipes with that ingredient sorted to the top or highlighted. 
- Once you make a new recipe or change something in a recipe, it does not get saved locally. So, when you open the application again it does not remember the recipe you entered, kind of defeating the purpose of the application. 

(i) The classes seem easily readable and well-documented, with good spacing and format of the code. Some things we can comment on for improvement is:
- The getDirections() method is a little unclear. Although it is described as a getter, it is more of a formatter for the String directions that exists as a raw string. This should be outlined in the description of the method, or two different ones should be made.
- There are debugging methods that seem to be called during unit tests, but they are made public, so anyone can access them! To fix this, adding a boolean that says debugMode would probably be useful to check if the method can be used.
- RecipePanel implements ActionListener, which may or may not be efficient, instead of making an inner class for Actionlistener. This way, it seems sort of cluttered to have this outer class implement it instead of having its own inner one. DeleteRecipe is an inner class, so why not AddRecipe too to be consistent?
- getRecipeByName() is an unimplemented TODO method that is commented out, which should be resolved or deleted. 
- In IngredientsList, it is unclear why the capacity must be at least 1, and should be explained in comments. Why can't you have an empty one?

(j) As stated previously, there are debug methods used in JUnit tests, but they are public. There are many JUnit tests, including GUI tests that use a "Robot" to click on actual GUI components to test them, which is useful. IngredientsListTest only tests the sizes of the object made, but it would probably be useful to give it some test cases and check if the object is being filled correctly. Otherwise, all classes except the one with main have tester classes.
